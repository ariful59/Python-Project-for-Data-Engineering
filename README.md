Python Project for Data Engineering
Overview
This project is part of the "Python Project for Data Engineering" course offered by IBM on Coursera. The primary objective is to acquire, process, and analyze data related to the world's largest banks. The project involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a database for further analysis.

Objectives
Data Extraction: Collect data using APIs and web scraping techniques.
Data Transformation: Process and clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Data Loading: Store the transformed data in a CSV file and a SQLite database.
Data Analysis: Perform queries on the database to retrieve specific information.
Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

banks_project.py: Main script containing functions for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
Largest_banks_data.csv: CSV file containing the raw data of the largest banks.
exchange_rate.csv: CSV file with exchange rate information for currency conversion.
Banks.db: SQLite database containing the processed data.
code_log.txt: Log file recording the steps and operations performed during the project.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
